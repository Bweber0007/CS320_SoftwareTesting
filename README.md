How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

In order to ensure that a program is functional and secure, software testing should be utilized. Software testing provides feedback to the development team on any issues a program may have whether it be functionality or security. Programs can be complex so it is important to implement tests that provide different environments and conditions for the program to execute. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs should be interpreted during the design stages of the SDLC. This allows the rest of the program to have a clear direction. In order to incorporate user needs into a program it is important to separate how a program works versus what it should achieve. Futhermore, it is important to separate these concerns between the development team and the testers. As long as the two teams have good communication, a project can be completed more efficiently and with fewer missteps along the way. This ultimately can provide a better product to the end user that aptly achieves what they want it to.


How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing softare through an iterative and modular approach. I believe it is important to focus on a single problem at a time and try to work through it from start to finish and visualize how the problem will be solved. This process is iterated for each individual issue and then I approach bringing them together. This design strategy can be beneficial when transitioning to the development stage if using OOP principles since they also utilize this modular approach.
